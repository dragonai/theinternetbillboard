# The Internet Billboard

A simple hack built to teach hackers the basics of Rails at MHacks IV. Venmo 50 cents to "Internet Billboard" and include a message, and your message will receive 30 seconds of primetime on the billboard. Any multiple of 50 cents will earn that many consecutive slots on the board.

Using: Rails, Rufus-Scheduler, Venmo API + Webhook, deployed on Heroku.
